## Introduction

This project is a simple warm-up to get you used to how this whole
project thing will go. It also serves to get you into the mindset of a C
programmer, something you will become quite familiar with over the next
few months. Good luck!

## Deliverable 1

Your first task is to familiarize yourself with the development
environment. To provide a standardized development environment, you will
be using a Docker container. Follow the instructions
[here](https://csci-442-mines.github.io/student-env/) to setup Docker
and your environment. We are using Docker so your code can run in an
environment similar to the autograder regardless of what your native
platform is.

After you have successfully complete the first two steps of the above
linked tutorial, you should have access to this starter code inside
container. **Please make sure you are in the container**

Run the command :

```shell
make && ./reverse
```

Take a screenshot of your terminal, including the result of the above
command. This is your submission for deliverable 1. It should say:

```
TODO: write a main function
```

## Deliverable 2

You will write a simple program called `reverse`. This program will be
invoked in one of the following ways:

```shell
./reverse input_file
./reverse input_file output_file
```

An input file might look like this:

```shell
hello
this
is

a file
```

The goal of the reversing program is to read in the data from the
specified input file and reverse it; thus, the lines should be printed
out in the reverse order of the input stream. Thus, for the
aforementioned example, the output should be:

```shell
a file

is
this
hello
```

The different ways to invoke the file (as above) all correspond to
slightly different ways of using this simple new Unix utility.

- When invoked with two command-line arguments, the program should
  read from the input file the user supplies and write the reversed
  version of said file to the output file the user supplies.
- When invoked with just one command-line argument, the user supplies
  the input file, but the file should be printed to the screen. In
  Unix-based systems, printing to the screen is the same as writing to
  a special file known as **standard output**, or `stdout` for short.

Sounds easy, right? It should. But there are a few details\...

### Assumptions

- **String length**: You may NOT assume _anything_ about how long a
  line can be. I.e., it may be VERY long, or quite short.
- **File length**: You may NOT assume _anything_ about how large a
  file is. Thus, you may have to read in a very large input file\...

### Errors You Need to Handle

On any of the errors below, you should print the error message to
`stderr` (standard error), **NOT** `stdout` (standard output). You can
accomplish this using `fprintf()`.

- **Input file is the same as the output file**: Print the error
  message `error: input and output file must differ` and exit with
  return code 1.
- **Invalid files**: If the user specifies an input or output file,
  and for some reason, when you try to open said file (e.g.,
  `input.txt`) and fail, print the error message
  `error: cannot open file 'input.txt'` (or whatever the file is
  named) and exit with return code 1.
- **System call fails**: All system calls can fail. For grading
  purposes, you can print any error message, but you must exit with a
  return code 1.
  - Ex: If `malloc()` fails, you can print any error message like
    `error: malloc failed` (or whatever the system call is named)
    and exit with return code 1.
- **Incorrect number of arguments passed to program**: Should too
  many, or too few, arguments be provided to `reverse`, then print the
  error message `usage: reverse <input> <output>` and exit with return
  code 1.
- **Memory Safety**: If your program is susceptible to buffer-overflow
  based on certain inputs, it is not memory safe.
  - You will lose points for using these memory unsafe functions:
    `strcat`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`, or `sprintf`.
  - Ex: If you try to use `getline()` and there is no space for the
    line you are trying to grab, you can print any useful message
    like `error: memory safety`, but you must exit with return
    code 1.

### Useful Routines

You may find the following manuals useful:

- `fopen(3)`
- `getline(3)`
- `fclose(3)`
- `malloc(3)` and `free(3)`
- `fprintf(3)`
- `exit(3)`

You can open these using the `man` command. For example:

```shell
man 3 fopen
```

### Tips

#### 1: Start small, and get things working incrementally

For example, first get a program that simply reads in the input file,
one line at a time, and prints out what it reads in. Compile your code
with the command `make` to test your work and check for memory safety.
Then, slowly add features and test them as you go.

Here are our recommended steps:

1.  First, write some code using `fopen()`, `getline()`, and `fclose()`
    to read an input file and print it out.

2.  Design how you will store the lines to be easily reversed later. A
    proper data structure makes all the difference here. Think back to
    262: would a map or set even be useful here? What about a stack or a
    queue? How might you implement one?

    >   you an hour of planning\" as the saying goes.
    > - But also don\'t over-engineer this. No need to have a perfect
    >   circular array or balanced binary tree. A linked list might be
    >   perfect in this scenario: quick to implement, and can easily
    >   be used to solve the problem at hand (_hint hint_).

3.  Write the code to store each input line into your data structure,
    and make sure that works.

4.  Use your data structure to print the lines in reverse order of the
    input file.

5.  Handle error cases, and so forth\...

#### 2: Testing is critical

A great programmer we once knew said you have to write five to ten lines
of test code for every line of code you produce; testing your code to
make sure it works is crucial.

- Write tests to see if your code handles all the cases you think it
  should.
- Be as comprehensive as you can be. Of course, when grading your
  projects, we will be. Thus, it is better if you find your bugs
  first, before we do.

We have provided some _basic_ tests for you to check against, you can
run them via:

```shell
./test-reverse.sh -v
```

However, **YOU WILL NEED TO TEST YOUR CODE ON MORE THAN JUST THE
PROVIDED TESTS**.

- The provided tests are _not_ comprehensive. All they do is check for
  basic error handling, and run the provided example.
- We will have no sympathy for students who only use the provided
  tests and then receive a poor score.

> [!WARNING]
> We will be using `diff` to verify your program produces the correct
> output. This means you will _not_ get partial credit on a within-test
> basis (i.e., you will either pass, or fail, each individual test. There
> is no in-between)
>
> This means if your program produces an even slightly incorrect output
> (e.g., missing the last character of the last line, produces extraneous
> output, throws an error, etc.), **you will get a 0 on that specific
> test**. Take extra care with testing to ensure that a minor error
> doesn\'t propogate and cause your program to fail all test cases.

#### 3: Keep old versions around

Keep copies of old versions of your program around, as you may introduce
bugs and not be able to easily undo them.

- Use **git** for this. This project is already a Git repository, so
  take advantage of all the version control features git provides!

### General Requirements

- Your program should have a zero exit status if no errors are
  encountered.
- Your project must be written in the C programming language, and
  execute on Dev Docker (student-env).
- You should follow [Linux Kernel coding
  style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.8/process/coding-style.html),
  a common style guide for open-source C projects.
- Your project must not execute external programs or use network
  resources.
- You should `free` any memory that you heap-allocate, and close any
  files that you open. If you do not, the flag `-fsanitize=address`
  will catch a memory leak which will be shown either in your console
  or in the \*.err file.
- To compile your code, the grader should be able to `cd` into the
  root directory of your repository and run `make` using the provided
  `Makefile`.

Your grade will be negatively impacted if you do not heed these
requirements.

### Collaboration Policy

Please see the syllabus for the course plagarism policies.

This is an **individual project**. Plagarism cases will be punished
harshly according to school policies.

Please do keep any Git repos private, even after you finish this course.
This will keep the project fun for future students!

## Submitting Your Project

Submission of your project will be handled via **Gradescope**.

1.  Create the submission file using the provided `make-submission`
    script:

```shell
./make-submission
```

2.  This will create a `.zip` file named `$USER-submission` (e.g., for
    me, this would be named `lhenke-submission.zip`).

3.  Submit this `.zip` file to Gradescope. You will get a confirmation
    email if you did this correctly.

> [!WARNING]
> You are **REQUIRED** to use `make-submission` to form the `.zip` file.
> Failure to do so may cause your program to not compile on Gradescope.
